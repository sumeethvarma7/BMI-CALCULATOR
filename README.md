This project uses AI & Machine Learning to predict natural disasters such as floods, cyclones, and extreme rainfall. The system analyzes factors like monsoon intensity, river management, deforestation, urbanization, and climate change to assess disaster risks.

Built in Google Colab using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, the notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, exploration, and basic predictive modeling.
